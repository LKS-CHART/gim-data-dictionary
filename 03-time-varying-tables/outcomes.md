# Outcomes

- **Filenames**: 
    -	Train: TBD
    -	Valid: TBD
    -	Test: TBD


- **Table Purpose**: : Contains the outcome variables. OUTCOME_ALL is a binary variable indicating whether the outcome occurs or not for the encounter. OUTCOME_TYPE describes the type of outcome. The remaining outcome variables describe whether the outcome occurs within a given time frame. For example, outcome_all_24 will be a 1 if the encounter experiences the outcome within 24 hours and 0 otherwise. 

- **Number of rows**: 
    - Train: 16,976
    -	Valid: 2,405
    -	Test: 958

- **Links to**: `ENCOUNTER_NUM`, `time_window`
